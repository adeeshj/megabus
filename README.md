megabus
=======
Created By: Adeesh Jain

This script takes inputs from a pre-defined SQL Database (config.db) and updates users of Megabus prices as they are changed for he day the user has specified in the SQL Database.  

Note: Current implementation can send users current prices, but real-time price tracking has not been implemented yet.

This requires the BeautifulSoup library to work.
