megabus
=======
Created By: Adeesh Jain

This script allows the user to input a date and output Megabus timings and pricings for that date.  Future implementation will allow the script to automatically check for new tickets and to check if prices have changed.

Note: the libraries urllib and BeautifulSoup are required for this to work.
